In all of the below, the question is, does the regular expression match the full string. This can be fully specified by preceding the regular expression with ^ (beginning-of-string character) and and following it with $ (end-of-string character); to aid legibility, we have nto included these characters. Slash (/) is the delimiter character showing where the regular expression begins and ends. Strings to be matched start and end with non-blank characters: there are no leading or trailing blanks.
